# 1. HF & post-HF methods
Review [1] provides a nice and clear introduction to HF & post-HF methods, while review [2] gives a more detailed and rigorous review. These two reviews will be mainly quoted here.
Throughout this file, the atomic unit is adopted, and the general coordinate $x=(\boldsymbol{r},\sigma)$ denotes both space and spin coordinate, where $\sigma\in\{1/2,-1/2\}$.

# 2. Introduction to HF approx
The HF theory is basically a mean field theory that solves the motion (wave function, i.e., orbit) of a single electron moving in the mean field of all electrons.
## 2.1. The general HF equations
The Hartree-Fock approximation approximates the total electron wave function as a Slater determinant:
$$|\psi_e\rangle \approx |\psi_{HF}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_e!}} \left| \begin{matrix}\psi_1(x_1) &\psi_1(x_2) &\dots &\psi_1(x_{N_3})\\
\psi_2(x_1) &\psi_2(x_2) &\dots &\psi_2(x_{N_3})\\
\dots &\dots &\dots & \dots\\
\psi_{N_e}(x_1) &\psi_{N_e}(x_2) &\dots &\psi_{N_e}(x_{N_3})\\
\end{matrix} \right|,$$ where the $\psi_{i}$'s are yet to be determined through the variational method. Note that $x$ is a general coordinate. In a more explicit form, each wave function contains a spin up part and a spin down part:
$$\psi(x)=\psi(\boldsymbol{r},\sigma)=\phi^{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{r})\alpha(\sigma) + \phi^{\beta}(\boldsymbol{r})\beta(\sigma),$$ where $\alpha(\sigma)=\delta_{\sigma,\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\beta(\sigma)=\delta_{\sigma,\frac{-1}{2}}$.

Minimizing the energy intergral using the HF determinant, one gets the HF equation
$$F[\psi]\psi_i(x) = \epsilon_i \psi_i(x),$$
where $F= h + \sum_{i=1}^{N_e}(J_i-K_i)$ is Fock operator, with the single electron term ($\boldsymbol{R}_I$ is the positions of nuclei / ions)
$$h=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2-\sum_{I=1}^{N_n}\frac{Z_Ie^2}{|\boldsymbol{R}_I-\boldsymbol{r}|},$$ the Coulomb operators
$$J_i[\psi]f(x)=\left(\int\frac{|\psi_j(x')|^2}{|\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}'|}\mathrm{d}x'\right)f(x),$$ and the exchange operators
$$K_j[\psi]f(x)=\left(\int\frac{\psi_j(x')f(x')}{|\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}'|} \mathrm{d}x'\right)\psi_j(x).$$ Note that $\int \mathrm{d}x=\sum_{\sigma} \int \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}$ includes both spin and space coordinate.

The HF equation(s) is actually an eigen value problem. But the Fock operator itself depends on the wave functions. Therefore, it should be solved in a iterative self-consistent manner.

## 2.2. Interpretation of the HF equations

Each function $\psi_j(x)$ can be interpreted as a single-electron orbit. Under this interpretation, the Fock equation can be interpreted as the equation of motion (the Schrodinger equation) of a single electron moving in the mean field of other electrons. The coulomb operator $J_i[\psi]$ is actually the mean electric field of atoms.

One of the most significant flaw of HF theory is that some coorelations are neglected due to the mean-field theory. (See the discussion on the ["electron correlation" page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_correlation) and ["Hartree-Fock method" page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method) on Wikipedia.) Mathematically speaking, the coorelation of two random variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ means their joint distribution is not a product of marginal distribution:
$$\rho(x_1,x_2)\neq \rho(x_1)\rho(x_2).$$ The Hartree Fock method includes some, but not all correlations.

### 2.2.1. No correlation in Hartree approx
If one use a direct product of single-electron orbit $\prod_i\phi_i(\boldsymbol{r}_i)$, it is called the Hartree approximation, and the resulting Hartree equations are
$$\left(h+\int\frac{\sum_{i\neq k} |\phi_i|^2}{|\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}'|}\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}'\right)\phi_k=\epsilon_k \phi_k.$$ (The spin part is omitted for simplicity). The integral is again the mean electric field of electrons, but the exchange term is absent. Using the Hartree approximation, on can show that
$$\rho(\boldsymbol{r}_1,\dots,\boldsymbol{r}_2)=\prod_i|\phi_i|^2=\prod_{i}\rho_i(\boldsymbol{r}_i),$$ i.e., there is no correlation between electrons.

### 2.2.2. Fermi correlation in Hartree-Fock approx
Now, in the Hartree-Fock approximation, the wave function $\psi(x_1,\dots,x_{N_e})$ is a determinant, which has correctly accounted for the permutation symmetry of electron. It leads to the exchange operator in the Fock equations, which can roughly be interpreted as the "exchange energy" or "exchange force" between fermions. The probability density
$$\rho(x_i,x_j)=N_e(N_e-1)\int \prod_{k\neq i,j}\mathrm{d}x_k |\psi(x_1,\dots,x_{N_e})|^2.$$ is the probability of finding *any* electron at $x_i$ and *any other* electron at $x_j$. Note that the factor should be $N_e(N_e-1)$ instead of $N_e(N_e-1)/2$ (the factor used in reference [2]) because the random variable $x_1,\dots,x_{N_e}$ is treated as distinguishable although the electrons are indistinguishable. It is easy to show that
$$\rho(x,x')=\rho(x)\rho(x')-\sum_{k,l}\psi_k^*(x)\psi_l^*(x')\psi_l(x)\psi_k(x'),$$ where $\rho(x)=\sum_k|\psi_k(x)|^2$ is the electron density. An interference term appears, which is a result of the Pauli-exclusion principle. It implies that some correlation has been included in the HF method due to the antisymmetry, and is termed "Fermi correlation".

However, due to the mean field nature of HF methods, the instant columb repulsion is not properly dealt with, therefore, the Columb correlation is not included in the HF methods. In literature, the term "correlation energy" often refers to the correlation energy not included in the HF method.

## 2.3. Restricted form of HF method
More simplifications are used to spin part of the general HF (GHF) equations to reduce computation. In the unrestricted HF (UHF) method, each single-electron orbit is approximated as a direct product of spacial function and spin function:
$$\psi_i(x)=\phi_i(\boldsymbol{r})\gamma_i(\sigma),$$ where $\gamma_i(\sigma)$ is either $\alpha(\sigma)$ or $\beta(\sigma)$. In other words, all orbits are chosen to be spin-up or spin-down eigen states. Let $N_A$ orbits $\psi_i$ with $i\in A=\{1,\dots,N_{\alpha}\}$ be spin-up states, and orbit $N_B$ orbits $\psi_i$ with $i \in B=\{N_{\alpha}+1,\dots,N\}$ be spin-down states. The HF equations can be splitted into two parts:
$$\begin{aligned}
&F_A[\phi]\phi_i = \epsilon_i^{\alpha}\phi_i,\quad i\in A,\\
&F_B[\phi]\phi_i = \epsilon_i^{\beta}\phi_i,\quad i\in B.\\
\end{aligned}$$ with 
$$\begin{aligned}
&F_A[\phi] = h+\sum_{j=1}^NJ_j[\phi]-\sum_{j\in A}K_j[\phi]\\
&F_B[\phi] = h+\sum_{j=1}^NJ_j[\phi]-\sum_{j\in B}K_j[\phi].
\end{aligned}$$
However, the total wave function is not an eigen state of the total spin operator $S^2$, this is called spin contamination. In the UHF equations, One can show that
$$\rho(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{r}',\sigma\neq \sigma')=\rho(\boldsymbol{r},\sigma)\rho(\boldsymbol{r}',\sigma'),$$ i.e., there is no correlation between electrons with anti-parallel spins, or correlation only exits within electrons with the same spin.

In addition to UHF, there is also restricted HF (RHF) method, where $N_A=N_B$ is imposed. Furthermore, the space parts of spin-up state and spin-down state are chosen to be the same. More explicitly, we have $\psi_{i}=\phi_i\alpha$ with $i=1,\dots,N/2$ and $\psi_i=\phi_{i-N/2}\beta$ with $i=N/2+1,\dots,N$.
RHF can only be used for systems with even number of electrons, and there is no spin-contamination. In a rough sense, it is convenient to interpret the electron configuration as electrons of different spins filling into fixed spacial orbits (molecular orbitals, MO). If all MOs are doubly occupied or empty, the configuration is called closed-shell, where RHF methods can be used. Otherwise the configuration is called open-shell, where UHF has to be used, or another restricted open-shell HF (ROHF) method can be applied.

## 2.4. Solving the HF equations
### 2.4.1. Self-consistent field (SCF) calculation
To solve the Fock equation $F[\psi]\psi_i=\epsilon_i \psi_i$, an iterative manner is often adopted (termed as self-consistent field calculation):
- First guess a set of trial functions $\psi_i^0$, then calculate the operator $F^0$.
- Solve the eigen value problem, and pick the lowest N energies and orbits $\psi_i^1$. (This is termed the aufbau principle, see[2] for details)
- Use the new orbits $\psi^1$ to calcualte $F^1$ and calculate the eigen value problem again. 
- Iterate until the difference between two iterations is small enough.

### 2.4.2. Basis set approx
To solve the eigen value problem, one choice is numerical integration, but a more popular method is to use the basis set approximation: the orbits $\psi_i$'s are approximated as a linear combination of a set of M basis function $\{\chi_a\}_{a=1}^M$, i.e., $\psi_i=\sum_a c_{ai}\chi_a$. The HF equation is then expaned into a matrix equation:
$$\sum_b F_{ab}[\psi]c_{bi}=\epsilon_i\sum_bS_{ab}c_{bi},$$ where $F_{ab} = \langle a | F | b\rangle$ and $S_{ab}=\langle a | S | b \rangle$ is the matrix elements of the Fock and overlap matrix. This matrix form is termed the Rothan-Hall equation. Details of the expansion are provided in [2].

For the choise of basis, a common choise is a set of functions confined to the vicinity of nuclei (i.e., LCAO). Plane wave is also commonly used for solids. For details, see [1] and [2]. The ideal case where the basis is complete is called the HF limit.
